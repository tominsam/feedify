Feedify makes Atom feeds out of your friends' Flickr and Instagram photo
feeds, and other things that don't already provide them, because I like
subscribing to things in a feed reader rather than having to check everything
every day.

As with most stuff I make it's fragile and will probably break. And you have
to be quite nerdy to understand why you'd even care. Nevertheless, I like it.

Feedify is live at <http://feedify.movieos.org/>
