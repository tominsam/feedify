<p>Feedify makes Atom feeds out of your friends' Flickr and Instagram photo feeds, and other things that don't already provide them, because I like subscribing to things in a feed reader rather than having to check everything every day.</p>

<p>As with most stuff I make it's fragile and will probably break. And you have to be quite nerdy to understand why you'd even care. Nevertheless, I like it.</p>


<h2>flickr</h2>
<p>Feedify recent uploads from your Flickr contacts.</p>
<p><a href="/flickr/">start here</a></p>

<h2>instagram</h2>
<p>Feedify recent uploads from your Instagram contacts.</p>
<p><a href="/instagram/">start here</a></p>
