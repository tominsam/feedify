<h2>feedify/instagram</h2>

<p>The intent was to get an RSS feed of the photos of my contacts. Instagram don't provide this, or any other RSS feeds. So I made one. I have a <a href="/flickr/">similar feed generator for Flickr photos if you want that</a>.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> to fetch the photos, but is not endorsed or certified by Instagram.</p>
