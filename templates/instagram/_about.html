<h2>feedify/instagram</h2>

<p>Similarly to the <a href="/flickr/">flickr one</a>, I wanted a feed of photos taken by my contacts. This does it. It uses the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> to fetch them.</p>

<p>As it stands, this app is pretty nerdy. If you don't know what an RSS/Atom feed is, it's not for you yet. It'll get better. <a href="mailto:tom@movieos.org">Send me mail</a> if you have complaints / suggestions.</p>
